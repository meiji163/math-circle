### Our Motto
"Ἀεὶ ὁ Θεὸς ὀ Μέγας γεωμετρεῖ" is derived from a quote by Plato meaning, "God always geometrizes."
It is also the beginning of a [piem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piphilology) written by Katharevousa

> Ἀεὶ ὁ Θεὸς ὀ Μέγας γεωμετρεῖ,  
> τὸ κύκλου μῆκος ἵνα ὁρίσῃ διαμέτρῳ,  
> παρήγαγεν ἀριθμὸν ἀπέραντον,  
> καὶ ὅν, φεῦ, οὐδέποτε ὅλον θνητοὶ θὰ εὕρωσι
