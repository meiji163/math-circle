### Mission Statment
While centered in the Temecula Valley, the **Temecula Valley Math Circle** (TVMC) is designed to centralize and enhance all competitive math programs throughout the Inland Empire. 

We intend to consolidate the diverse and unique skill set of each participating school to compete in the most elite competitions across the globe. 
To achieve this, the TVMC will hold weekly meetings for members in one of three types of sessions: guest speakers, math lectures, and internal competitions. 

 Temecula Valley Math Circle will also arrange teams consisting of the greatest mathletes throughout the valley to represent Temecula Valley in global competitions. 
 TVMC members will benefit from the combined knowledge and resources of all participating schools, allowing them to prosper at the highest levels of competitive mathematics. 

### People
The Temecula Valley Math Circle was established in 2021 by [Steve Maxey](https://www.tvusd.k12.ca.us/domain/5656) and several of his current and past students. Students are also actively involved in running the circle.

### Our Motto
"Ἀεὶ ὁ Θεὸς ὀ Μέγας γεωμετρεῖ" is derived from a quote by Plato meaning, "God always geometrizes."
It is also the beginning of a [piem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piphilology) written by Katharevousa

> Ἀεὶ ὁ Θεὸς ὀ Μέγας γεωμετρεῖ,  
> τὸ κύκλου μῆκος ἵνα ὁρίσῃ διαμέτρῳ,  
> παρήγαγεν ἀριθμὸν ἀπέραντον,  
> καὶ ὅν, φεῦ, οὐδέποτε ὅλον θνητοὶ θὰ εὕρωσι
